# Love Letter Playground

This repo has three components:
1. Utilities for training agents to play Love Letter in a multi-agent setting.
2. A collection ("zoo") of pre-trained agents.
3. An interface to watch agents play against each other, or to play them yourself!

Agents are currently trained using the Stable Baselines 3 framework, but support for other
frameworks may be added in the future.

## To Run
